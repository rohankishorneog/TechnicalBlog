        <h1>My Journey</h1>
        <p>As a student learning web development, I have found it to be an exciting and rewarding journey. There is always something new to learn and discover in this field, and the skills I have acquired have opened up many doors for me.
        </p>
            
        <p>To get started, I familiarized myself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the three core technologies used to build web pages and web applications. I learned how to use a text editor to write code and a web browser to view and test my work.
        </p><p>
         I have also found it helpful to practice regularly and stay up-to-date with new developments in the field. I am excited to see where my learning journey will take me next.</p>
